			<h3>Digital Drawing</h3>
			<p>Learning how to drawing on my computer is my current focus right now. I am using a software called Clip Studio Paint. I know that SAI is also another very popular software for digital art, but since I got a free copy of Clip Studio Paint" from Miku Expo 2014, I might as well use it.</p>
			<p>Aside from the softwares mentioned above, I know that sometimes Photoshop will come in handy for effects. I havn't tried it yet, though.</p>
			<p>The style I want to learn is the Japanese Animation/Manga style. I frequently browse on pixiv, and was amazed at some of the awesome art those people created. I wish that, someday, I can draw as well as them.</p>

			<h3>Music Creation</h3>
			<p>I have been playing classical instruments since I was small. Right now, I can play violin, viola, cello, and piano. I main the viola, though, if you're wondering.</p>
			<p>Perhaps what made me interested in music creation is Hatsune Miku, a vocaloid created in 2006. I was enamored with that concept when I first found out about it in 2007, and that's what sparked my interest in music making.</p>
			<p>Thus, I plan to create a vocaloid song one day through Studio One as well as Miku's voicebank. I will probably not be creating anything that does not have vocaloid in it, even though I like a lot of other genres.</p>

			<h3>Other Hobbies</h3>
			<p>I love cats. I love technology. I love games.</p>

			<h3>Visual Novel Creation</h3>
			<p>My inspiration of creating Visual Novels actually comes from my friend, who also wanted to create something of the sort. We both liked reading them, but he was the one to inspire me to start working on something.</p>
			<p>Aside from him, the works of <a href="http://nekocharon.web.fc2.com/">Charon</a>, a Japanese indie game developer who create visual novels out of the RPG Maker 2000, was someone I look up to in terms of short visual novels. I gotta say, his games are insane. Literally.</p>
			<p>I use renpy to create my Visual Novels. So far, I have created four short stories, using them primarily as learning experiences rather than a finished project.</p>
